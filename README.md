# 🛋️ Comfy Store

An e-commerce demo application built with **React** based on John Smilga’s React course.  
While the project follows the general structure of the course, I also made several tweaks and adjustments of my own to better understand React concepts and practice customizing features. 

Deployed live on **Netlify**: [Comfy Store Live](https://marijas-comfy-store.netlify.app/)

## Purpose of this project

This project was built to practice React fundamentals, state management with the Context API, and routing. It represents one of my first larger React projects and served as a key step in building more complex applications. Although it started as a course project, I experimented with it and made modifications to ensure I understood the logic instead of just following along.
